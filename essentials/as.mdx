The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. For example, if you wanted to style the background color of an element, you would use the following:

```aether
dec bgColor as background-color;
```

In this example, `background-color` is the style property that you want to style. The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. Here's another example:

```aether
dec bgColor as darkModeColor;
```

In this example, `bgColor` is the style property that you want to style. The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. In this case, `darkModeColor`.

  property.
