# Functions

Functions are a powerful feature of aether. They allow you to define a block of code that can be called. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
imp config from "aetherConfig";
config {
    typesafety: true;
}

function myFunction() {
    return "Hello, world!";
}
```

In this example, we are defining a function called `myFunction`. This function returns the string `"Hello, world!"`. We can call this function using the following syntax:

```aether
myFunction();
```

In this example, we are calling the function `myFunction`. This will return the string `"Hello, world!"`.

## Function parameters

Functions can also take parameters. This is useful if you want to pass values to the function. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
imp config from "aetherConfig";
config {
    typesafety: true;
}

function myFunction(param1: string, param2: number) {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

In this example, we are defining a function called `myFunction`. This function takes two parameters: `param1` and `param2`. These parameters are both strings and numbers, respectively. The function returns the sum of the two parameters.

## Function return type

Functions can also have a return type. This is useful if you want to specify the type of value that the function returns. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
imp config from "aetherConfig";
config {
    typesafety: true;
}

function myFunction(param1: string, param2: number): string {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

In this example, we are defining a function called `myFunction`. This function takes two parameters: `param1` and `param2`. These parameters are both strings and numbers, respectively. The function returns a string.

## Functions as values

You can also use functions as values. This is useful if you want to use a function as a value. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
imp config from "aetherConfig";
config {
    typesafety: true;
}

function myFunction(param1: number, param2: number): number {
    return param1 + param2;
}

let myFunctionValue = myFunction();
```

In this example, we are defining a function called `myFunction`. This function takes two parameters: `param1` and `param2`. These parameters are both strings and numbers, respectively. The function returns a string. We are then declaring a variable called `myFunctionValue` and assigning it the value of the function `myFunction`.

# Conditionals

Conditionals, function similarly to conditionals in other programming languages. They are used to execute a block of code based on a condition. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
function myFunction(param1: string): string {
    if (param1 === "hello") {
        return "Hello, world!";
    } else {
        return "Goodbye, world!";
    }
}

myFunction("hello");
```

In this example, we are defining a function called `myFunction`. This function takes two parameters: `param1` and `param2`. These parameters are both strings and numbers, respectively. The function returns a string. We are then declaring a variable called `myFunctionValue` and assigning it the value of the function `myFunction`.

# Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
repeat (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

Notice anything different? Aether has multiple variable declaration methods. `var` is exclusive to loops, and is used to declare a variable that is only available in the loop. This allows the loops to be more useful to you.
