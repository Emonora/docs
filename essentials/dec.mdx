The `dec` keyword is used **to declare a style property.** There are two ways that it can be written:

`dec` followed by a style property name

or

`declare` followed by a style property name (more on this later)

# Style Property Names

<Tip>
  You can use all of the available styling options in css with the std library.
  (Excludes flex and grid)
</Tip>

Style property names are the names of the properties that you want to style. **They are the names of the CSS properties that you want to style.** For example, if you wanted to style the background color of an element, you would use the following: `dec bgColor`.

The compiler can understand the following style property name syntaxes:

`bgColor` - This is the camel case version of the style property name. It is the most common way to write style property names.

`bgcolor` - This is the lowercase version of the style property name. It is the second most common way to write style property names.

`background-color` - This is the kebab case version of the style property name. It is the third most common way to write style property names.

`BackgroundColor` - This is the pascal case version of the style property name. It is the fourth most common way to write style property names.

# Using `declare` instead of `dec`

What's the difference between `dec` and `declare`? **Verbosity.** Both the `dec` and `declare` keywords do the exact same thing.

<Warning>
  The `declare` keyword is not valid normally. You have to enable verbose mode
  in the config file to use it. More [here](config).
</Warning>

After enabling verbose mode, you can use the `declare` keyword to declare a style property. The syntax is as follows:

```aether
declare bgColor;
```
