The `for` keyword is used to tell aether what elements to target.

```aether
for @item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

Essentially, this keyword is used to tell aether what to style. The methodology for it is as follows:

You use `for` to tell aether "This is what I want to style".

## Selectors

Selectors are the way to target and style elements in aether. Below are the currently supported selectors:

- **Bulk Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their class name.
- **Individual Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their individual identifier.

### Bulk Selectors

You use the `@` symbol to tell aether what you want to style. The `@` symbol is used to denote a class name. So, for example, if you wanted to style all elements with the class `item`, you would use the following code:

```aether
for @item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

In this example, `@item` is the selector that tells aether to target all elements with the class `item`.

### Individual element Selectors

You can also use the `#` symbol to denote a specific element. For example, if you wanted to style a specific element with the identifier `item`, you would use the following code:

```aether
for #item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

In this example, `#item` is the selector that tells aether to target the element with the identifier `item`.
