Sometimes, when you read documentation, you have to read a lot of pages to truly understand the language. On this page is a simple aether file, and config.

## Simple aether file

```aether
for @item {
    dec bgColor as defaultBGColor with value #000000;
    dec textColor as defaultTextColor with value #FFFFFF;
    dec fontSize as defaultFontSize;
    dec fontFamily as defaultFontFamily;

    let fontFamily = "Arial, sans-serif";
    let fontSize = 16px;

    exp defaultBGColor, defaultTextColor;
}
```

This is a simple aether file. It declares some styles, and exports a couple of them.

## Config file

The config file is a file that is used to configure aether. It is used to set up the environment variables, and to set up the default values for the variables. There are numerous ways to write a config file. You can explore all possible options on the individual config page later on, but here is a quick run down.

<Tip>Your config file should be named `rules.config.aether`</Tip>

### Syntax

The syntax for a basic config file with an environment variable is as follows:

```aether
import config from "aetherConfig";

for * {
    dec bgColor as defaultBGColor with value "#000000";
}

config {
    minify: true;
    typesafety: true;
    globalVariables: true;
    verboseMode: true;
}
```

This is a simple config file. It configures the aether environment, and sets some environment variables.
