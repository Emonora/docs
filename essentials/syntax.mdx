# Syntax

Sometimes, when you read documentation, you have to read a lot of pages to truly understand the language. On this page is every single kind of syntax in the std library.

## for

The `for` keyword is used to tell aether what elements to target.

```aether
for @item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

Essentially, this keyword is used to tell aether what to style. The methodology for it is as follows:

You use `for` to tell aether "This is what I want to style".

### Selectors

Selectors are the way to target and style elements in aether. Below are the currently supported selectors:

- **Element Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their class name.
- **Individual Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their individual identifier.

#### Element Selectors

You use the `@` symbol to tell aether what you want to style. The `@` symbol is used to denote a class name. So, for example, if you wanted to style all elements with the class `item`, you would use the following code:

```aether
for @item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

In this example, `@item` is the selector that tells aether to target all elements with the class `item`.

#### Individual element Selectors

You can also use the `#` symbol to denote a specific element. For example, if you wanted to style a specific element with the id `item`, you would use the following code:

```aether
for #item {
    <YOUR CODE HERE>
}
```

In this example, `#item` is the selector that tells aether to target the element with the identifier `item`.

## dec

The `dec` keyword is used to declare a style property. There are two ways that it can be written:

`dec` followed by a style property name

or

`declare` followed by a style property name (more on this later)

### Style Property Names

Style property names are the names of the properties that you want to style. They are the names of the CSS properties that you want to style. For example, if you wanted to style the background color of an element, you would use the following: `dec bgColor`.

The compiler can understand the following style property name syntaxes:

`bgColor` - This is the camel case version of the style property name. It is the most common way to write style property names.

`bgcolor` - This is the lowercase version of the style property name. It is the second most common way to write style property names.

`background-color` - This is the kebab case version of the style property name. It is the third most common way to write style property names.

`BackgroundColor` - This is the pascal case version of the style property name. It is the fourth most common way to write style property names.

Of coure, you can use any of the above syntaxes, but what if you want a custom name? Thats where the next keyword comes in.

## as

The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. For example, if you wanted to style the background color of an element, you would use the following:

```aether
dec bgColor as background-color;
```

In this example, `background-color` is the style property that you want to style. The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. Here's another example:

```aether
dec bgColor as darkModeColor;
```

In this example, `bgColor` is the style property that you want to style. The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as. In this case, `darkModeColor`
