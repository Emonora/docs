# Selectors

Selectors are the way to target and style elements in aether.

Using them is relatively simple. Below is a simple selector example:

```aether

for @item {
    dec bgColor as background-color;

    let backgroundColor = "#000000";
}
```

Let's break this down:

The `for` keyword is used to tell aether what elements to target.

The `@item` is the selector. It tells aether to target all elements with the class `item` where `item` is the class name of the element you want to target.

The `dec` keyword is used to declare a new style property where `bgColor` is the name of the style property.

The `as` keyword is used to tell aether what the style property should be referred to as, in this case `background-color`.

The `let` keyword is used to assign a value to `background-color`

The `;` at the end of the line is used to terminate the statement.

## Selector Types

There are two types of selectors in aether:

- **Element Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their class name.
- **Individual Selectors** - Used to target elements based on their individual identifier.

### Element Selectors

Element selectors are used to target elements based on their class name. They are denoted by the `@` symbol followed by the class name of the element you want to target.

For example, if you want to target all elements with the class `item`, you would use the following selector:

```aether
for @item {
    dec bgColor as background-color;
    let backgroundColor = "#000000";
}
```

In this example, `@item` is the selector that tells aether to target all elements with the class `item`.

### Individual element Selectors

Individual element selectors are used to target a specific element rather than a group of them. They are very useful for applying individual styles.

For example, you want to target a specific element with the identifier `item-1`, you would use the following selector:

```aether
for #item-1 {
    dec bgColor as background-color;
    let backgroundColor = "#000000";
}
```

In this example, `#item-1` is the selector that tells aether to target the element with the identifier `item-1`.
